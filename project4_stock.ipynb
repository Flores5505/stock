    "I initially noticed that the Dow Jones was currently down 268.97 points so I was interested in finding out which companies were accounting for such a drastic change. The two main culprits appeared to be UniteHealth Group Inc. and Boeing Company, with a change in 9.47 and 13.00 respectively. I decided to buy Boeing over UnitedHealth beacuse looking at 3 month graphs for both of the companies' stock revealed that UnitedHealth had just started dipping and is still 20 more than in september, while Boeing dipped much faster to 5 below September's price. I expect Boeing to start increasing soon and for UnitedHealth to decrease a bit more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking through the Nasdaq 100 revealed that Okta had just dipped to 35 below it's three month high which occured early in September. It's stock change compared to the previous close was down 23.34 . Taking these two facts into account I expect this company to be a safe purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I decided to purchase stock of Walmart because it just started recovering from a downward trend from it's three month high in the beggining of November. I am expecting them to move lots of merchandise for black friday and christmas and hopefully that will help the stock increase more."
